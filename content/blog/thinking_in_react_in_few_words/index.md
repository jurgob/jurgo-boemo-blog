# Thinking in React

In an era dominated by AI agents and vibecoding, mastering the fundamentals has never been more important. That's why I created my own version of [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) and the [Tic Tac Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) tutorial - shorter, easier, with Typescript and slot machines.

## The "Minimal State" Principle

Thereâ€™s a core idea in [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) thatâ€™s both crucial and often misunderstood: **Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state**.
Everyone agrees with this in principle, yet I see many developers struggling in practice. 

Letâ€™s look at an example. Suppose you want a `User` type with `birthDate` and `age`:

```ts
type User = {
  birthDate: string,
  age: number
}
```

You might write:

```ts
const user: User = {
  birthDate: "2022/11/21",
  age: 2
}
```

This is incorrect. The problem is that `birthDate` and `age` must stay in sync â€” and that's fragile..

### A Better Approach

Instead, compute `age` from `birthDate`:

```ts
function ageFromDate(dateString: string){
    const birth = new Date(dateString);
    const today = new Date();
    
    let age = today.getFullYear() - birth.getFullYear();
    const monthDiff = today.getMonth() - birth.getMonth();
    
    // Adjust age if birthday hasn't occurred this year yet
    if (monthDiff < 0 || (monthDiff === 0 && today.getDate() < birth.getDate())) {
      age--;
    }
    
    return age;
}

const person = {
  birthDate: "2022/11/21",
  
  get age(): number {
    return ageFromDate(this.birthDate)
  }
};
```

> ðŸ’¡ If youâ€™re not familiar with JavaScript getters, [check them out here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get).

You could write an OOP version of this, but the point is clear: **`age` should not be stored â€” itâ€™s derived from `birthDate`.**

## The React Tic Tac Toe Challenge

Now that we understand minimal state, letâ€™s bring that into React.

Where do you store state in React? If you're not using an external state manager, you use the `useState` hook.

Hereâ€™s the challenge:  
**How many `useState` hooks do you need to implement Tic Tac Toe?**

The answer: **Only one â€” and not the one you're probably thinking.**

> ðŸ§  Want to try it yourself? Or check out the full [Tic Tac Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) for a more patient explanation.

But if you're like me and want the fast version:

```ts
  const initialMovesHistory: Move[] = [];
  const [movesHistory, setMoveHistory] = useState(initialMovesHistory);
```

Thatâ€™s it! The only state you need is the **history of moves** for the current game.  
[Check the code here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-6q5ngvmj) (open [App.tsx](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-6q5ngvmj?file=src%2FApp.tsx)) and see the magic in action.

### Defining Types

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™re working with:

```ts
type Player = 'x' | 'o';
type Move = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 ;
type GameHistory = Move[];
```

- A `Player` can be `'x'` or `'o'`. Nothing to see here.
- A `Move` is just a grid index (0â€“8). 
- A `GameHistory` is a list of moves.

### But Who Made the Move?

You might wonder:  
> Why am I not storing the player in the `Move`?

Because you can **derive** it. If `'x'` always starts first, then:

- Even-indexed moves in the history (`0, 2, 4, â€¦`) belong to `'x'`.
- Odd-indexed moves (`1, 3, 5, â€¦`) belong to `'o'`.

```ts
function getPlayerFromMoveIndex(movesHistoryLength: number): Player {
  return movesHistoryLength % 2 === 0 ? 'x' : 'o';
}
```

---


## Determining Game Status

The next derived value is the **game status**. Hereâ€™s how:

```ts
const winningCombinations: Move[][] = [
  [0, 1, 2],
  [3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8],
  [0, 4, 8],
  [2, 4, 6],
  [0, 3, 6],
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
] as const;

type GameStatus =
  | {
      status: 'inprogress';
      player: Player;
    }
  | {
      status: 'ended:tie';
    }
  | {
      status: 'ended:won';
      player: Player;
    };

function gameStatus(movesHistory: GameHistory): GameStatus {
  const hlen = movesHistory.length;
  for (const [a, b, c] of winningComps) {
    const aPlayer = getPlayerForSquare(a, movesHistory);
    if (aPlayer) {
      const bPlayer = getPlayerForSquare(b, movesHistory);
      const cPlayer = getPlayerForSquare(c, movesHistory);
      if (aPlayer == bPlayer && bPlayer === cPlayer) {
        return {
          status: 'ended:won',
          player: aPlayer,
        };
      }
    }
  }

  if (hlen >= GRID_SIZE) {
    return {
      status: 'ended:tie',
    };
  }
  return {
    status: 'inprogress',
    player: getPlayerFromMoveIndex(hlen),
  };
}
```

From just the `movesHistory` and a set of `winningCombinations`, you can fully determine:

- Whether the game is still in progress.
- If it ended in a tie.
- If someone won â€” and who they are.

## Thatâ€™s All, Folks!

Everything else is glue code and some CSS. Again, [check the full code here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-6q5ngvmj?file=README.md,src%2FApp.tsx) if you're curious.


## A Note on Performance

You might be concerned about performance â€” but in most real apps, bottlenecks come from side effects like:

- HTTP requests
- Local storage access
- Expensive re-renders

Donâ€™t prematurely optimize.
