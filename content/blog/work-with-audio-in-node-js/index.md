Hello, I m Jurgo and I work as a node.js developer at Vonage. What I do there is this [Conversation API](https://developer.nexmo.com/conversation/overview) . Sometime I describe it as an “api for doing your own slack”.

Because of this product, sometimes I have to deal with audio. I found that audio is a very scaring topic in the beginning, mainly because of the lack of documentation.

I m far from being an audio expert, but over the years I ‘ve managed to make some working code using the few audio related libraries you can find in NPM, so I ve decided to share this jurney in this series of articles

This is gonna be our jurney:
